# Lab 01: RPG Characters

* Author: David Garcia
* Class: CPSC 221 Section 00X
* Semester: Fall 2023

## Overview
In this program we are implementing the principles of inheritance. We do so by creating six RPG Characters
which share some commonalities but ultimately also have unique skills. We are attempting to reduce code duplication
when designing inherited classes and showing a clear understanding of the use of abstract methods, classes as well as 
protected variables and implementing a sound is-a relationship with each class. 

## Compiling and Using
To compile we created the Adventure class which contains the code necessary
to print out each one of our characters displaying theiur unique abilities and traits. 
Each character is supposed to display their hitpoints, armorclass and tarits such as the type of
weapon they use or special ability they posses.

## Discussion
I had a problem where I couldn't use one of my abstract classes. I ultimately had to erase
my knight and recreate him in my adventure class in order for him to work.
I also wish I had given myself more time to create some more abstract classes 
as I feel I could have grouped them by armor or weapon class as well. ultimatelyI ran out of time 
so this must happen past the deadline.

## Testing
Testing wise I ran the program via my adventure class and made sure my output matched the example given.
Being lab 1 there's no input required from the user, it is simply a demosnstration of the usage of abstract classes and
inheritance so the only thing you will see as a user is the output we hard coded.
